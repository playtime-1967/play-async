# Async programming with Tokio
Covering cross-task communication, async channels, locks, TCP/UDP sockets, and task cancellation; implemented a chat server with user notifications and message broadcasting, a key-value in-memory server enabling clients to perform CRUD operations, and a proxy server that forwards data between a client and a target server.

-------------
# 1- Chat App  

This is an asynchronous chat server built using [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), leveraging `TcpListener`, `TcpStream`, and `mpsc` channels for efficient message handling. The server supports multiple clients and broadcasts messages while maintaining a simple peer-to-peer communication structure.  

## Features  
- Asynchronous message handling with Tokio  
- Multi-client support with non-blocking I/O  
- Broadcast system for real-time chat  

## Steps to run  
Run the chat server with:  
```sh
cargo run --bin chat 127.0.0.1:6142
```  
or   specify a port
```sh
cargo run --bin chat
```  
The server will start listening on **127.0.0.1:6142** by default.  

Clients/Peers can connect via `nc` (Netcat), `telnet` or a custom client:  
```sh
nc 127.0.0.1 6142
```  
or specify a port  
```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 6142
```

# 2- Key-value Storage Server
A lightweight asynchronous key-value storage server built using Tokio. It supports GET, SET, and DELETE operations over a TCP connection, allowing multiple clients to interact concurrently.  


## **Features**  
- Asynchronous I/O
- Thread-safe in-memory storage
- Concurrent client support
- Basic command support: `GET`, `SET`, `DEL`  
- Custom error handling and response serialization  

### **Run the Server**  
```sh
cargo run --bin key-value-storage
```
or specify a port:
```sh
cargo run --bin key-value-storage 127.0.0.1:4162
```
The server will start listening on **127.0.0.1:4162** by default.

Connect via `nc` (Netcat) or `telnet`
```sh
nc 127.0.0.1 4162
```

### **Supported Commands**  
After connecting, you can execute the following commands:

#### ‚úÖ **Store a Value**
```
SET key value
```
Example:
```
SET foo bar
```
Response:
```
set foo = `bar`, previous: Some("old_value")
```

#### üîç **Retrieve a Value**
```
GET key
```
Example:
```
GET foo
```
Response:
```
foo = bar
```

#### ‚ùå **Delete a Key**
```
DEL key
```
Example:
```
DEL foo
```
Response:
```
deleted foo!
```

#### ‚ùå **Handle Nonexistent Keys**
```
GET unknown
```
```
DEL unknown
```  
Response:
```
error: no key unknown
```

Example Output:

# 3- Proxy Server

A lightweight **TCP proxy server** built with [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/). It listens for incoming connections, forwards data between a client and a target server, and allows seamless communication between applications.

## Features
- Asynchronous I/O
- Bidirectional data transfer

### Run the Server
```sh
cargo run --bin 127.0.0.1:2748 127.0.0.1:4162
```
- The first argument (**127.0.0.1:2748**) is the **proxy's listening address**.  
- The second argument (**127.0.0.1:4162**) is the **destination server address** where traffic will be forwarded.  

If no arguments are provided, it defaults to:
- **Listening on:** `127.0.0.1:2748`  
- **Forwarding to:** `127.0.0.1:4162`  

## Usage
1. Start your **destination server** on `127.0.0.1:4162` (you can run the key-value storage server as the destination and observe how it functions exactly as if the client were connecting to it directly, but this time through the proxy server).  
2. Run the **proxy server** (as shown above).  
3. Connect via `nc` (Netcat) or `telnet` to `127.0.0.1:2748`.  
4. The proxy will forward all traffic to `127.0.0.1:4162`.  

‚ö† If the destination server isn't running and the client sends a request to the proxy, the proxy will fail and exit with the following error:  

**Error:** `Os { code: 111, kind: ConnectionRefused, message: "Connection refused" }`
